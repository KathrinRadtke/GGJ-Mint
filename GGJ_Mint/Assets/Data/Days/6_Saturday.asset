  textMessage: Me again. It's such a lovely day today and I miss our walks. Want
    to meet at the park this evening? I'll bring the puppy ;)
  prompt:
  - ' I miss our walks too. I used to have so many things I was excited to tell them
    that happened during the week. '
  - Now I have nothing to say. It would be awkward to just walk in silence for hour,
    I'd probably bore them.

  activityMessage:
  - Sorry for neglecting you, my love.
  - I'll always have you for company.
  - I hope you're not terribly out of tune by now.
  - Do I remember how to play anything?
  - I really should start practicing every day again, there are so many pieces I
    want to learn but I can barely play a scale anymore.
